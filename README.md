Churn rate is a metric that measures the extent to which customers stop using a product or service. We look at the general status of the bank and narrow the focus to exit customers. Here, we understand customer behavior and uncover any patterns or trends of customers exiting. To analyze this, we group customers with similar characteristics and needs together. To achieve this, we use two metrics: age and bank balance. Finally, we look at the possible solutions to the customer churn problem and determine strategies to retain customers.

The dataset is bank data with 10,000 customers in France, Germany, and Spain. Five thousand one hundred fifty-one customers are active and 4,849 inactive. More than half of our customers are active. The bank has customer deposits totaling 765 million. Depositors with the most significant balances are between the ages 31–40, followed by 41–50, and the third, 26–30. Notably, these three age groups contribute more than 80% of total deposits and have the highest number of inactive accounts.




Germany has a peculiarly higher churn rate of 32%, compared to France and Spain, with 16.15% and 16.67%, respectively. However, exit customer behavior is observed to be the same across the three countries. The three highest exit customer groups are aged 41–50, 31–40 and 51–60. One thousand seven hundred seventy-four exit customers belong to the three age groups, representing more than 87% of all exits.



Our exit customers’ balances represent the extreme ends of the balance spectrum, with customers with balances between over 100,000 and 150,000, the third-highest balance group, exiting the most. The second highest exits are customers with the least balances between 0–10,000. These two groups represent 73% of all exits. An interesting observation is customers who used more than one product were less likely to stop using the bank’s services. Of all 2037 exit customers, 1409 had used only one product. The bank offers four products. 96% of exit customers had used one product. It is also noted that customers who were new to the bank for less than four years and those who had stayed more than six years were less likely to stop using the bank.

RECOMMENDATIONS

OFFER WIDER RANGE OF PRODUCTS

Customers who use more products are more likely to stay. It is necessary to offer products addressing the needs of customers. Different age groups have different needs, but same age groups display almost similar needs.

The cash-rich 41–50 age group is likely doing well in their careers and looking for retirement investments. In this age group, most are likely to have a family with some children in college or about to. Offering retirement and high-value investment products for high-net-worth individuals looking to grow and protect their wealth could capture this market group.

The 31–40 age group is likely young parents with young families looking to buy a home and invest in their children’s education. Products such as mortgages and home equity loans are attractive to this segment. Education savings plans allowing long-term planning for children’s education are essential for the age group.

The 51–60 age group is nearly retired or retired, with the majority having grown kids just about starting their careers or buying their first homes. In this age group, the majority have accumulated wealth and are likely to have moderate to low-risk appetites. Products offering estate planning, wealth management, and retirement planning services will likely capture this age group.

For customers with deposits over 100,000, high-yield products could be offered to attract this customer group. They comprise 58% of all exits.

SURVEY CUSTOMERS WITH A TENURE OF 4–6 YEARS

Customers who have stayed with the bank between 4–6 years are more likely to leave. Surveys could be done to understand the customers’ needs and complaints better. The survey will diagnose the high churn rate for these tenures.

INTRODUCE OR DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT MARKETING STRATEGIES

From the analysis above, most customers using the bank’s products are less likely to leave. In contrast, nearly all who have left have only used one product. The bank must market its products and inform customers of what it offers. Marketing campaigns should be employed or better strategies should be employed to inform more customers and non-customers of what the bank offers.
