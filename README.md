# Bank-Churn-Analysis
In this analysis, I analyze a bank customer dataset.
I first look at the general status of the bank and understand the current situation.
I delve into the customers exiting to investigate which types of customers are leaving and uncover patterns in the exiting customers. 
I create a dashboard visualizing all the answers from the general status of the bank to the customers exiting. More analytics on the nature of customers are also available in the dashboard.
Finally, I create a report outlining the findings and offer reccomendations on the issue of customer churn to guide decision making. Data driven decision making!
